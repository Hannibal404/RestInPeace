**User Manual**

Once you pass the introduction to the app and login, you'll be faced with 4 options, namely:

* Meditation
* Yoga
* Sleep
* Relax

The functions of each are explained below.

**Meditation**

To start the day, or to take a break while working, or to unwind after a hard day of work, just grab your noise cancellation headphones, select the duration you want to settle down and meditate for and select if you want to be notified when the period starts and ends and start meditating. The app will keep track of how long you have meditated and also notify you when your selected duration has ended (based on your choice).

**Yoga**

Place your phone somewhere or get someone to hold it for you and select any of the multiple asanas and the trained model will tell you if you are doing it correctly using your camera.

**Sleep**

Select any of the 20+ soothing sounds from the 4 categories and let them play as they help you to sleep a peaceful and deep sleep and help you relax after a day of hard work.

**Relax**

On a scale of 0 - 10 (10 being in the best mood and 0 being very low), tell the app how you're feeling, and it will plot a graph of how you have been feeling for the past month.



(Note that some features are still under development and will be deployed soon)

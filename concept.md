**Application Concept**

In these tough times, when most of us are disturbed because of this pandemic this app can help us to rejuvenate a bit. It consists of soothing natural voices to listen to while working, studying, sleeping or meditating, details about many yogic asanas and the correct way to perform them using models trained using Deep Learning and Machine Learning, it also keeps track of how you've been feeling everyday for the past month and plots a graph according to it. We have developed this app from scratch in the DART language and Flutter framework.

(Note that although the app is usable, some features are still under development and will be deployed soon)
